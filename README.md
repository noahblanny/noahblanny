I am a sophomore studying cybersecurity at St. John's University in Jamaica, Queens. I have always had a deep interest in computers and have always wanted to pursue a career in technology. I enjoy music and music history, particularly jazz, classical, and jazz rap. My interest in music has led me to explore audio encryption and broadening my understanding of cybersecurity in the entertainment industry.

Objective

My current objective is to begin my career in cybersecurity and to officially join the field. I want to build my skills to become an invaluable part of any organization I work with.
